After attending Data Structures Recitation on Wednesday night with Professor Korth, I was unable to fix two bugs: 
Because I am evaluating this character by character, I should be able to read numbers with more than one digit (AKA 200). However, I am unable to do so. 

The second bug is that in my stack class, it actually reverses the pop order. 

Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I am unable to finish out the two bugs. I hope that this works for the time being and thanks so much!
