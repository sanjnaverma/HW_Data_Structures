/**
 * It will take an ordinary text file, record the frequencies of characters
 * used in that file, then use assignment #4's code to find the 
 * Huffman encoding. 
 * 
 * Next, we will use these to convert our text file 
 * into its equivalent Huffman encoding. 
 * 
 * Lastly, we will compare the # 
 * of bits used in the Huffman encoding versus the standard ASCII encoding.  
 * (This always encodes 7-8 bits per character, regardless of that 
 * characterâ€™s frequency.)
 *
 *
 * @author sanjnaverma 
 *The text file used will have several lines \n (newline characters) count as 
 *characters, as well as any letters, numbers, spaces, tabs, comma, periods, colons, 
 *etc. Also, there is a difference between upper-case and lower-case letters for 
 *this assignment. 
 *
 *Hence, the frequency of Q is not the same thing as the frequency of q. 
 *Also, the text file must END with a newline character.
 *
 *
 *
 *We can convert integers to characters and vice versa using Java's 
 *built-in ASCII conversion. We can convert an int i into a char c by doing 
 *c = (char)i. Similarly, we can convert a char c into an int i by doing 
 *i = (int)c. This allows us to use the arrays count[] and code[] to keep track of 
 *the count and Huffman encoding for each character. Hence, for some char c, 
 *count[(int)c] tells us how often c occurs, and code[(int)c] tells us the 
 *Huffman encoding for character c. However, please remember that there are only 
 *256 (or even 128) legal characters on most machines 
 *(which is also the size of the ASCII table). 
 *Hence, we can't convert the number 300 into a character.
